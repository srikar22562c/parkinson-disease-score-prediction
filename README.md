# parkinson-disease-prediction-regression


This project implements a fully connected neural network to predict clinical Parkinson’s disease progression scores (motor_UPDRS and total_UPDRS) using the Parkinson’s Telemonitoring dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The task is formulated as a multi-output regression problem, where the model learns to map biomedical voice measurements to disease severity scores.

The model is designed, trained, and evaluated following a complete deep learning pipeline including data preprocessing, architecture selection using validation performance, learning rate scheduling, and test-set evaluation.
